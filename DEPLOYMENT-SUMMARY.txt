IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
1. The dist folder is Git-ignored, but the deployment package contains 
   everything from dist - nothing is missing.

2. .env is Git-ignored for security, but environment variables are already
   compiled into the JavaScript bundle - no manual configuration needed.

3. .htaccess is critical for React Router to work properly. Ensure it's
   uploaded and readable.

4. Current admin authentication is mock/demo. For production, integrate
   with Supabase authentication.

SUPPORT
-------
If deployment issues occur:
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify .htaccess is present and readable
- Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
- Review cPanel error logs
- Ensure all files from tar.gz are extracted
